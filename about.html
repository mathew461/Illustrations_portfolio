			<p class = "lower_p">Hello!</p>
			<p class = "lower_p">I'm a game designer with 12 years of professional game industry experience.
				I left the AAA game industry in 2019 to return to Pittsburgh, PA and focus on independent games.
				In the AAA industry, I was most recently working on The Last of Us Part II.</p>
				
			<p class = "lower_p">I mostly focus on designing, building, and scripting games packed with fun narrative-based 
				gameplay and exciting scripted events. I do system and narrative design as well. I have a penchant for making 
				things easily accessible while still retaining fun gameplay depth.</p>
			 	
			<p class = "lower_p">I thrive in creative and collaborative environments where hard work and passion for 
				making great games is valued, and where I can leverage my strong technical background to enhance my designs 
				and team.</p>
